There is a lot of speculation that Fairy Peak may not be able to compete with the more recent talent that has emerged in 1v1.  Also, I believe him being away is given too much credit.

To be clear, when Fairy stepped away from ones, he did not go off and become worse at Rocket League.  His wall control improved.  His speed to ball improved.  Rebounds, flip resets, recoveries have all improved.  Some things improved immensely.  Once his comfort with the 1v1 format returns to something near what it was at his peak, these aspects of his game will be allowed to shine.  

It's difficult to pull out all the stops playing careful, but anyone who has taken a substantial break from ones knows that it takes time to become adjusted.

If Fairy back?  It's difficult to tell.

In Fairy's return to ones in the Fusion Tournament qualifiers there were flashes of Fairy peak of old and even improvements that could lead to him being much deadlier than before.

One thing to note.  Fairy was not as clinical as he was before.  Monkey Moon is a very good player and Fairy handled him with little difficulty but there were several occasions when Fairy was caught too far forward.  This hardly ever happened in his 1v1 prime.  His instincts aren't tuned to 1v1 they.  They are tuned to 3v3.  His positioning on those play is not terrible in 3v3, as you could grab a nice 50 in the opponents half and worse case scenario, it is clear over your head to a waiting teammate.

Fairy is in the process of breaking habits that he honestly would probably prefer not to break.  I feel like we will see a Fairy that tries to commit to the 1v1 style just enough to make due.  The scary thing is:  that might be enough to win the whole thing if Fairy's ceiling is what I think it is.

My big question is "How will Fairy do against mechanical gods like Aztral and Joreuz?".

Even in his prime, Fairy would still dominate, but dominate less against players with extremely high pop-off potential.  But, it is difficult for players to consistently hit clips in a competive 1v1 match and hardly anyone could keep clipping for an entire series.  The rare occasions that they did, they actually took Fairy Peak down (think osm, think scrub).

In a perfect world, 1v1 would become integrated into the Rocket League Championship series and Fairy could show us what his true potential actualized would look like without detrimenting his teammates.

Until then we will have to live with the flashes of greatness.  

No matter what the Fusion Tournament is going to provide an abundance of sweaty matchups for us to analyze!
