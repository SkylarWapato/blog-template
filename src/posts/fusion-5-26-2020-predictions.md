## Fusion Tournament 2020 Day 1 in the books!

See our [recap](https://www.1vee1.com/posts/fusion-5-25-2020-recap) to see how your team faired.

## The 3v3

### [Rogue](https://liquipedia.net/rocketleague/Rogue) VS [Stromboli](https://liquipedia.net/rocketleague/Stromboli)

Rogue should have Stromboli covered in both skill and experience.  I'm calling Rogue with a comfortable win.

**Pick: Rogue 4-2**

## The 2v2

### [Spacestation Gaming](https://liquipedia.net/rocketleague/Spacestation_Gaming) VS [Divine](https://liquipedia.net/rocketleague/Divine)

Bubble teams tend to have success in twos so this game could be deceptively challenging for Spacestation.  That would be if [Sypical](https://www.twitch.tv/sypical) wasn't a mainstay on the top 5 2v2 leaderboard.  SSG with comfort.

**Pick: Spacestation Gaming 4-2**

## The 1v1

### [72 Pin Connector](https://liquipedia.net/rocketleague/72_Pin_Connector) VS [Stromboli](https://liquipedia.net/rocketleague/Stromboli)

I'm not sure if Stromboli has anyone near [LionBlaze](https://www.twitch.tv/lionblaze246)'s level that they can strut out for 1v1.  I think Lion comes out on top in a landslide.

**Pick: LionBlaze 4-0**
