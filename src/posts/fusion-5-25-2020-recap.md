# ***Spoilers Below!***

## 2020-05-25 Summary: My record 2 - 1


Some heroics by magicbear stole the show!.... and also ended my chances of a perfect bracket within the first game.  I'm currently 2-1 with no perfect predictions.

## The 3v3

### [Affinity](https://liquipedia.net/rocketleague/Affinity) VS [72 Pin Connector](https://liquipedia.net/rocketleague/72_Pin_Connector)

**Predicted result:** 72 Pin Connector 4-2

**Final result:** Affinity 4-3

Affinity suffered 3 straight losses before pulling of a clutch reverse sweep.

## The 2v2

### [Team Envy](https://liquipedia.net/rocketleague/Team_Envy) VS [Rogue](https://liquipedia.net/rocketleague/Rogue)

**Predicted result:** Rogue 4-3

**Final result:** Rogue 4-2

Team Envy had strokes of genius in what is still under 10 professional matchups for Retals on the team.  Team Envy should still be coming out of this thinking the acquisition was a good move.  Retals has a balancing presence in times of (in-game) uncertainty.

## The 1v1

### [Divine](https://liquipedia.net/rocketleague/Divine) VS [Vision](https://liquipedia.net/rocketleague/Vision)

**Predicted result:** Divine 4-0

**Final result** Divine 4-2

JRuss (formerly chicken) plays at an unforgiving place and ultimately overwhelmed Kinseh.
