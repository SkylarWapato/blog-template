## Is Fairy Peak back in 1v1?

There is a lot of speculation that Fairy Peak may not be able to compete with the more recent talent that has emerged in 1v1.  Also, I believe him being away is given too much credit and it is not valid to assume that his 1v1 performance must suffer (long term).

To be clear, when Fairy stepped away from ones, he did not go off and become worse at Rocket League.  His wall control improved.  His speed to ball improved.  Rebounds, flip resets, recoveries have all improved.  Some things improved immensely.  Once his comfort with the 1v1 format returns to something near what it was at his peak, these aspects of his game will be allowed to shine.  

It's difficult to pull out all the stops playing carefully, but anyone who has taken a substantial break from ones knows that it takes time to become adjusted.

If Fairy back?  It's difficult to tell.

In Fairy's return to ones in the Fusion Tournament qualifiers there were flashes of Fairy peak of old and even improvements that could lead to him being much deadlier than before.

## 1v1 and 3v3 are Fundamentally Different

One thing to note.  Fairy was not as clinical as he was before.  Monkey Moon is a very good player and Fairy handled him with relative ease but there were several occasions when Fairy was caught too far forward.  This hardly ever happened in his 1v1 prime.  His instincts aren't tuned to 1v1.  They are tuned to 3v3.  His positioning on those play is not terrible in 3v3, as you could grab a nice 50 in the opponents half and worse case scenario, it is cleared over your head to a waiting teammate.

Fairy is in the process of breaking habits that he honestly would probably prefer not to break.  I feel like we will see a Fairy that tries to commit to the 1v1 style just enough to make due.  The scary thing is:  that might be enough to win the whole thing if Fairy's ceiling is what I think it is.

## Rocket League 1v1 is evolving to become more mechanical

My big question is "How will Fairy do against mechanical gods like Aztral and Joreuz?".

Even in his prime, Fairy would still dominate, but dominate less against players with extremely high pop-off potential on their best day.  But, it is difficult for players to consistently hit clips in a competive 1v1 match and hardly anyone could keep clipping for an entire series against.  The rare occasions that they did, they actually took Fairy Peak down (think osm, think scrub).

## Renault Vitality Era

It's true that incredible clips appeared to be the only way to beat Fairy (they beat everyone, that's why they are clips).  But even this strategy didn't work before Scrub, Kaydop, and Fairy teamed up.

Fairy Peak's descension from the top of 1v1 began once he became a member of Renault Vitality.

Many people assume that occured later but that was simply because Fairy Peak was so much better than the other 1v1 talent at the time that he had a buffer.

**He was able to win 6 LOR games with ones on the backburner.**

Any game mode to which Fairy Peak has dedicated his full attention to lead to him becoming inserted into the conversation of best player in the world (for the given play mode).

Fairy Peak is clinical and deadly with his precision.  The way he plays the game requires him to develop an exhaustive philosophy of "How to play the game" doing this for two game modes would cause the other to suffer.

Fairy Peak's teammates rely on him to give them the **best** chance to win.  This means no dabbling in other game modes that, as of yet, cannot lead to a World Championship.

In a perfect world, 1v1 would become integrated into the Rocket League Championship series and Fairy (if he is interested) could show us what his true potential actualized would look like without detrimenting his 3v3 teammates.

Until then we will have to live with the flashes of greatness.  

No matter what, the Fusion Tournament is going to provide an abundance of sweaty matchups for us to analyze!
