On the precipice of the [Fusion Tournament](https://fusion-rl.com/), the 1v1 climate is hot.  With legends of old, such as Fairy Peak or Squishy Muffins, being thrusted back into the 1v1 scene.

Can they contend with the formidable forces that have grown in their absence?  Only time will tell.

Let's get this party started!

## 5 - [AyyJayy](https://www.twitch.tv/ayyjayy)

With compelling aerial play and elite ground control, AyyJayy has established himself as the man to beat in NA.

## 4 - [ScrubKilla](https://www.twitch.tv/scrub)

Scrub blends the flash of an Eekso type player with the pragmatism of Fairy Peak.  Which leads to very entertaining content.  Scrub is an outlier in that his rank is relatively low but he consistently takes games off of others on this list.  If anything his lack of commitment to the mode enhances how impressive his performances are.

## 3 - Joreuz

With clips that would challenge the likes of Aztral, Joreuz finds himself quite high on our list.  He remains the only player to have beaten Okhalid in a showmatch.  Don't let his clips fool you, Joreuz can grind out a win as well.  It's odd to see a player with so much pop off potential to not depend heavily on boost, but Joreuz does not.  He is very comfortable glued to an opponent, picking up small pads.  

It's nice to see a player with cracked mechanics keeping himself grounded and respecting the fundamentals.  That is Joreuz

## 2 - [OSM](https://www.twitch.tv/osm_rl)

Unfortunately, we haven't seen much of OSM these days.  But the ranked leader board would suggest that, as of late, OSM has Okhalid's number.

OSM reminds us that Rocket League is supposed to be fun.  He routinely takes breaks from try-harding and has fun with free styling.  It always leaves us asking "What would happen if OSM try-harded all the time"

It appears that when he switches gears he flies to the top or near top.  OSM is the "teen Gohan" of Rocket League.  If you approach him when he's pulled up his try-hard pants you're likely to come away with a loss.

## 1 - Okhalid

No surprise here

No wasted movement, never surprised by a bounce, knows what his opponents are going to do before they do.  These are just a few things that Okhalid brings to the table.  We wondered if we'd ever see a player that would compare to Fairy Peak in his prime.

We didn't have to wait long.

Okhalid doesn't have great games.

He doesn't have bad games.

Every game is an Okhalid game.

He crushes opponents with unstoppable bounce dribbles.  When others are running out of steam by game 5, Okhalid is prepared to bring the same level of play game in and game out.  If you're lucky enough to have moderate success, he dips in to a formidable bag of tricks.  Okhalid's mechanics will confuse casual observes looking for flashy plays to inform their opinions on mechanics.  Make no mistake, the mechanics Okhalid has mastered leads more directly to 1v1 wins than anyone in the world.
