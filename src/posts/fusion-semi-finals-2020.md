description: Rocket League Fusion Tournament 2020 Quarter Final recap and Semi-Final predictions.  No Squishy Muffins. Team Rogue (Kronovi, Firstkiller, and Turinturo) looks unstoppable.

## Kronovi and Rogue are playing great Rocket League

Currently, Rogue appear to be the most versatile team in Rocket League.  They have won all of their matchups.  One-on-one, two-on-two, or three-on-three, it doesn't seem to matter for these guys.  

## Fusion Tournament Quarter Finals

Firstkiller, MagicBear, JRuss, and LionBlaze come out of the quarter final bracket alive.  Honestly, LionBlaze was the only of these victors to struggle in their win.  FirstKiller was prepared to dominate SpaceStation Gaming's entire team.

Things get much more difficult from here.  All four of these guys are the top of the top in NA and it will be very entertaining to watch them duke it out.

## Fusion Tournament Semi-Finals

I am currently 5-1 on my predictions but I'll be the first to admit that the games in the Quarter Finals are much easier to call.  This is due to tournament seeding leading to obvious disparities.  There is no more of that.  Every remaining matchup will be extremely sweaty and tough to call.

But, let's give it a shot!

## [FirstKiller](https://www.twitch.tv/firstkiller91) VS [MagicBear](https://www.twitch.tv/majicbearrl)

Most of the Rocket League community seems to believe that Firstkiller hasn't lost a step in one-on-one.  I disagree, he had enough buffer that him losing a step could still be enough to win the whole tournament but I believe MagicBear comes out of this one in a TIGHT series

**MagicBear: 4-3**

## [LionBlaze](https://www.twitch.tv/lionblaze246) VS [JRuss](https://twitter.com/jrcrl_)

This is the hardest game I've called in this entire tournament.  These two players are so good and their playstyles so different, that it is very difficult for me to pick a winner.  

JRuss looks out of his mind and I believe he would be a hard out for anyone in the world.  He overwhelms his opponent's with pressure and incredible pop-off potential.  But, LionBlaze does not get overwhelmed.  He is patient and has taken top NA talent's best shot and came out with series wins.

Still, with what I've been seeing from JRuss I just can't pick against him.

**JRuss: 4-3**
