## [Magicbear](https://www.twitch.tv/majicbearrl) has connection issues

Unfortunately, the highly anticipated match between Firstkiller and Magicbear immediately lost steam. 

Apparently, a storm passed over Magicbear's home town and caused significant internet connectivity issues.  At a 3-3 tie two minutes into the first game Magicbear dropped out

## [Jordan](https://twitter.com/Jordan_RL1) VS Goliath AKA [Firstkiller](https://www.twitch.tv/firstkiller91)

These turn of events led to Jordan, Magicbear's teammate who has not focussed on ones nearly as much as Magicbear, subbing in for ~2.5 games.

Jordan started off competitive and overall gave us a really good show considering the odds.  In the end, Firstkiller asserted himself as significantly better than Jordan in the one-on-one arena

## Return of [Magicbear](https://www.twitch.tv/majicbearrl)

Magicbear subbed back in down 3-0 in the series.  I'm not convinced his internet was working properly and also feel that there is a significant chance that he had gone cold trying to sort out his issues.

Firstkiller went on to handidly defeat MagicBear 8-3.

## Do not underestimate [Firstkiller](https://www.twitch.tv/firstkiller91)

Perhaps, I should take my own advice on this one?  Firstkiller is so controlled when playing fast paced that I don't think I totally comprehend how fast he's actually going.  

Against Sypical and Arsenal I could see he was quick, but I chalked that up to their inexperience in elite 1v1.  Against Magicbear I was amazed at how deadly Firstkiller's speed was.  MagicBear had made all of his recent victims appear slow and First did it to him.
