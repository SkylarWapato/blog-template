## Let the real Rocket League games begin

The [Fusion Tournament](https://fusion-rl.com/) Qualifiers have completed. The teams are set and the first batch of games will soon commence!

## The 3v3

### [Affinity](https://liquipedia.net/rocketleague/Affinity) VS [72 Pin Connector](https://liquipedia.net/rocketleague/72_Pin_Connector)

This one is tough to call.  Even though this is a 3v3 Magic Bear of Affinity and LionBlaze of 72 are a couple of the scariest NA 1v1 players in the world.

**Pick: 72 Pin Connecter 4-2**

## The 2v2

### [Team Envy](https://liquipedia.net/rocketleague/Team_Envy) VS [Rogue](https://liquipedia.net/rocketleague/Rogue)

Rogue overall, is set up well for this format.  I think they grind out a tight series.

**Pick: Rogue 4-3**

## The 1v1

### [Divine](https://liquipedia.net/rocketleague/Divine) VS [Vision](https://liquipedia.net/rocketleague/Vision)

JRuss is in the conversation for best 1v1 player in NA in my opinion.  Comfortable win for JRuss.

**Pick: Divine 4-0**
